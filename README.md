Welcome to my repository for the CS 210 course! This repository contains all the projects I completed during the summer quarter, showcasing a range of topics and programming techniques covered in the course.

Repository Structure
The projects are organized into separate folders, each representing a specific project or assignment completed during the course.

Project List

- Two Rockets (Completed on 7/8/2024): The Two Rockets project involves creating a text-based representation of two rockets side by side using Python. The program leverages methods to avoid code repetition, making the structure both modular and easy to maintain.

- Word_Count (Completed on 7/18/2024): The Word Count project is a simple Python program that accepts a string input from the user and counts the number of words in that string. This project focuses on string manipulation and basic text processing.

- Space Needle (Completed on 7/12/2024): The Space Needle project involves creating a visual representation of the iconic Space Needle using text characters and Python's for loop. This project focuses on using loops and basic text manipulation techniques to print a structured and recognizable shape of the Space Needle directly to the console.
  
- Greetings (Completed on 7/14/2024): The Greetings project is a simple program that generates a personalized greeting message for the user. The program takes input from the user, including their name and birth year, and then prints a greeting message in a specific format along with an estimate of their age.

- Ehrenstein Illusion (Completed on 7/15/2024): The Ehrenstein Illusion project consists of two parts, each focusing on different graphical elements and movement.

      Part 1: Yellow Circles with Sub-Figures
        In this part of the assignment, the program opens a panel that displays yellow circles with a specific number of sub-figures inside them. This visualization is related to the Ehrenstein illusion, where the arrangement of shapes creates the illusion of contours or other visual effects.

      Part 2: Moving Car Figures
        The second part of the assignment involves animating car figures that move across the screen. This part focuses on basic animation principles and simulates car movement along a defined path.

- Birthdays (Completed on 7/17/2024): The Birthdays program is designed to compare the birthdays of two people and provide detailed information about their upcoming birthdays. The program asks for today's date and the birthdates of two individuals, then compares the dates to provide next birthday, birthday comparison and birthday wishes.

- GuessingGame (Completed on 7/25/2024): The Guessing Game project is an interactive game where the user is challenged to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number, and then offers the option to play again. When the user decides to stop playing, the program provides a summary of their performance.

- Personality Test Calculator (Completed on 8/2/2024): The Personality Test Calculator project is a program that analyzes the results of a personality test based on answers stored in a text file. The text file contains the names of the individuals who took the test and their corresponding answers. The program processes this data, categorizes the answers, and calculates the percentage of 'B' answer
  
- Rational Number (Completed on 8/5/2024): The Rational Number project involves creating a Python class that serves as a template for creating and working with rational numbers (fractions). This class provides methods for performing basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—on rational number objects.
  
- Baby Names (Completed on 8/11/2024): The Baby Names program allows users to input a name and search for its popularity over certain years. The program reads from a file containing a list of names along with their popularity rankings in various years. Upon finding the name, the program prints the popularity information and generates an output file named after the user input (e.g., input_name.txt).
